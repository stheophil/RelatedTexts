============

A simple "related texts" matching engine for the [wahlversprechen](https://github.com/stheophil/wahlversprechen) project.

It builds simple text statistics over a list of items, e.g. summaries of election promises. 
It pulls and scrapes articles from RSS feeds and finds which election promises currently occur in the news. 

Still very much work in progress.
